If you would like to have live reload you can use gulp-webserver, which will watch for your file changes and reload page, this way you don't have to press F5 every time on your page:

Here is how to do it:

    Open command prompt (cmd) and type

    npm install --save-dev gulp-webserver

    Enter Ctrl+Shift+P in VS Code and type Configure Task Runner. Select it and press enter. It will open tasks.json file for you. Remove everything from it end enter just following code

tasks.json

{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "command": "gulp",
    "isShellCommand": true,
    "args": [
        "--no-color"
    ],
    "tasks": [
        {
            "taskName": "webserver",
            "isBuildCommand": true,
            "showOutput": "always"
        }
    ]
}

    In the root directory of your project add gulpfile.js and enter following code:

gulpfile.js

var gulp = require('gulp'),
    webserver = require('gulp-webserver');

gulp.task('webserver', function () {
    gulp.src('app')
        .pipe(webserver({
            livereload: true,
            open: true
        }));
});

    Now in VS Code enter Ctrl+Shift+P and type "Run Task" when you enter it you will see your task "webserver" selected and press enter.

Your webserver now will open your page in your default browser. Now any changes that you will do to your HTML or CSS pages will be automatically reloaded.

You can also run your task just by entering Ctrl+P and type task webserver
